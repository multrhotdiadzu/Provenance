## How to Create a Windows Vista x64 Recovery Disc
 
If you bought your Windows Vista x64 computer from a major manufacturer, such as Dell, HP, Acer or Toshiba, you may not have received a Windows Vista installation disc with your purchase. Instead, you may have a recovery partition on your hard drive or a recovery disc that came with your computer.
 
A recovery partition is a hidden section of your hard drive that contains a copy of the factory settings of your computer. A recovery disc is a CD or DVD that contains a copy of the recovery partition or an image of your system. Both options allow you to restore your computer to its original state, but they also erase all your personal files and settings.
 
If you want to create a Windows Vista x64 recovery disc that can be used to repair or refresh your system without losing your data, you will need to use a third-party tool, such as Easy Recovery Essentials (or EasyRE). EasyRE is a downloadable software that can create a bootable recovery disc for any Windows version, including Windows Vista x64.
 
To create a Windows Vista x64 recovery disc with EasyRE, follow these steps:
 
1. Download EasyRE for Windows Vista from [https://neosmart.net/EasyRE/](https://neosmart.net/EasyRE/).[^2^]
2. Burn the downloaded image file to a CD, DVD or USB drive using any burning software, such as ImgBurn or Rufus.
3. Label the disc or drive as "Windows Vista x64 Recovery Disc" and keep it in a safe place.

## What to Do If You Don't Have a Windows Vista x64 Recovery Disc

- If your computer has a recovery partition, press F8 repeatedly during boot up and select Repair your computer from the Advanced Boot Options menu. This will launch the same recovery options as the recovery disc.
- If your computer has an Internet connection, press F8 repeatedly during boot up and select Repair your computer from the Advanced Boot Options menu.
